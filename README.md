- ðŸ‘‹My name is Rakesh and I am excited to share with you a little bit about myself and my projects through this README file on my Github profile.

I am a passionate CS student with a background in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript. I enjoy creating elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems and am always looking to learn and grow in my field.

Currently, I'm learning things and exploring this world of coding.

I believe in the power of collaboration and welcome any contributions or feedback on my projects. So, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or ideas you'd like to share!

Thank you :)
